# AMD Power Management Controller (PMC) Configuration
# Created by: Claude Code on 2024-12-24
# Purpose: Fix suspend/resume issues on Framework 13 AMD
#
# This configuration ensures the PMC module loads after its dependencies
# and disables the Smart Trace Buffer (STB) debug feature which can
# cause probe failures on some systems.

# Ensure CCP (AMD Cryptographic Coprocessor) loads before PMC
# The PMC relies on CCP for secure communication with the SMU
softdep amd_pmc pre: ccp

# Disable Smart Trace Buffer - can cause "SMU cmd failed" errors
# The STB is a debug feature that's not needed for normal operation
options amd_pmc enable_stb=0
