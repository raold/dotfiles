# Created by: Claude Code on 2024-12-24
# Purpose: Fix display resume issues after suspend
#
# These options address known issues with display not coming back
# after suspend on AMD Ryzen 7040 series laptops.

# PSR is a power-saving feature that can cause black screen on resume
# Bit 4 (0x10) of dcdebugmask disables PSR
options amdgpu dcdebugmask=0x10

# Disable scatter-gather display
# SG display can cause issues with display buffer management on resume
options amdgpu sg_display=0
